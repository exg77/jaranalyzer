JarAnalyzer is a dependency management utility for jar files. It's primary purpose is to traverse through a directory, parse each of the jar files in that directory, and identify the dependencies between the jar files. The output is an xml file representing the Physical Dependencies between the jar files.

JarAnalyzer's current homepage containing more descriptive and detailed usage information can be found [here](http://www.kirkk.com/main/Main/JarAnalyzer).

As I move the project over to Google Code, I'll update the project description with this detailed information.
